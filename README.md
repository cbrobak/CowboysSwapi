## This is a very simple site, on the landing page there are two buttons. Click the one labeled `People`, to access a list of characters, then click on a character to get a short bio about them, including any films they are in. If you click the film link from this page it will bring up a small movie bio, where you can access the characters. The `Films` button works much the same way. It brings up a list of all movies and clicking on a link for a movie brings up a short bio. 

### I used Bootstrap mostly for styling, as I am not much of a design person, my interest is mostly in database management and functionality. There are a few lines of css however.

### I used javascript for pretty much everything on this project. I'm reasonably certain best poractices were not followed, and with a bit more time and practice ther code would have been a lot more clean and dry.

### I do hope you like this site, please email me with any questions or comments at `cbrobak79@gmail.com`
